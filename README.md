## :mag: About the assignment

[The complete assignment](./docs/requirements/Anforderungskatalog.pdf). TL;DR:

> Create a web application to manage task lists (ToDo-Lists). [...] The implementation has to be in the form of a single page application (SPA) and be based on a current XAMPP installation under Windows 10 that can be run without further adjustments. For the implementation only a selection of libraries and frameworks are allowed. In case of doubt, please ask!
